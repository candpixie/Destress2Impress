# Welcome to Destress to Impress.

Clear your mind. Perform your ultimate best.

Destress to Impress--a PennApps project where entertainment intersects with mental health
- An EmotiBit + AI powered ENTERTAINMENT app that turns stress into a signal for fun resets — music, memes, and mini-games to help students clear their head and perform better.

Functions:
- Reads stress/excitement signals from EmotiBit (HR, HRV, GSR)
- Series of games to rewind: Flappy Bird with breathing cues.
- 🎵  Playlists of AI-curated music to rejuvenate.
- 😂 Bunch of AI-generated memes based on current trends to reboot.
- Short recs of movies.
- Tracks how mood changes after interventions (temporal feedback)

Not Therapeutic, but Entertatinment. Why?
<30, stress is constant — exams, internships, just life. But people already turn to music, memes, and games as coping tools. Destress to Impress taps into that energy and makes it reactive to your actual emotional state.
So...?
